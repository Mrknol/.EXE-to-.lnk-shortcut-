# .EXE-to-.lnk-shortcut-
Converts executables to shortcuts which can run your file.

This tool is intended for only educational purposes only.

# About

This script is written in Python 3.8. It's written completely by me MrKnol.

There are certain prerequisite modules that need to be installed if you don't have them already in order for the script to run properly.

pip install winshell

pip install pypiwin32

This basically is a Dropper. It just downloads the file and executes it upon download.

# Functionality

What this script basically does is create a shortcut and the edits the Target location and adds arguments which allows it to run PowerShell and execute commands.

This doesn't make your File Undetectable or FUD in anyway! 

This is my first program uploaded on Github, hope this broadens your coding knowledge in any way.

# Use

First you should upload your .exe to a server where you can download it using a direct link.

1. Enter the direct link of your file.

2. Enter the location where you want your exe to be dropped (The shortcut will always be dropped on desktop unless you change the code.)

3. Enter the file name of the exe you want to drop.

4. You'll find a shortcut on the desktop which will should download & execute your exe! :)
